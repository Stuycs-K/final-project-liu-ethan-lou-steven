Group Name: Dashing Dawgs
## Overview
A simplified version of geometry dash involving a moving screen from left to right with obstacles in the way such as spikes and walls. There will also be jump pads and various jump circles. We plan on also adding a few extra modes such as the spaceship, ball, and ufo if time permits. Level design will either be taken from original geometry dash levels or made by ourselves to fit our project.

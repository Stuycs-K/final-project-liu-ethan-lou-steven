## Overview
This is a simplified version of geometry dash involving a moving screen from left to right with obstacles in the way such as spikes and walls. There are a total of 5 different kinds of objects in the game: blocks, spikes, jump pads, orbs, and portals. There are two game modes currently: cube mode and wave mode. You can select between different levels and play them and you can also edit the levels.

## Instructions
Click the button on the top left to toggle between play mode and edit mode. 

#### Edit Mode:
* There are 5 different buttons at the top of the screen when you enter edit mode.
* Click on a button to choose which type of obstacle you want to place down and click on an empty space to place it there.
* If you click on an existing block, press 'D' to delete it.
* If you click and drag on an existing block, you can change it's size.
* You can scroll with your mouse wheel to navigate the level in edit mode.

#### Play Mode:
* Press 'W' to become invincible (for testing purposes)
* Press 'SPACE BAR' to jump
* Press 'S' to toggle between wave mode and cube mode (for testing purposes)
